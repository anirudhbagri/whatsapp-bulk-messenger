# Whatsapp-Bulk-Messenger

Whatsapp Bulk Messenger automates sending of messages via Whatsapp Web. The tool can you used to send whatsapp message in bulk. Program uses runs through a list of numbers provided in numbers.txt and then tries to send a prediefined (but templated) message to each number in the list. It can also read other columns from the number csv to populate template specific words and then send out a personalized message to the number

Note: The current program is limited to sending only TEXT message

Note: Another version of similar project is available which supports sending media and documents along with text. As per many requests, I have added a [video here](https://youtu.be/NNkAh5sLEok) demonstrating how the app works. Please reach out to me on [email](mailto:bagrianirudh@gmail.com) for more enquiry.
